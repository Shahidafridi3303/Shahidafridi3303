## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a passionate game developer, I am currently pursuing my game 
programming advanced diploma at George Brown College. With 2 years of
experience in Unity and Unreal Engine, I have developed skills in C++, 
C#, and Blueprints, enabling me to create several 2D and 3D games. 
Collaborating with a team of 20 experts in their fields, we 
successfully developed a 3D multiplayer game in Unreal Engine. 
Utilizing GitHub and Jira for project flow, several iterations to meet AAA standards.
